        <h2> <i>Overview</i></h2>
        <p> When it comes to deciding where and how to advertise it is important to think about every avenue. In reccent years the use of social media has dramatically spiked, having a whopping 3 billion people utalizing differnt online social media apps, according to Hootsuite. This has opened many new doors for different business to advertise on various social medias.</p>
        <p> Apps like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter are just a few popular places businesses have began to use for advertising. Before jumping right into which social media platform to use, it is important to figure out who you are trying to target and reach.</p>
        <p> For example, there is plenty of public information on the internet that you can obtain to determine who generally uses what apps. Facebook, for example according to SproutSocial sees that 84% of 18-29 year olds use the app, holding the biggest percentage of people in all age ranges. This sort of information is crucial when choosing a platform. You want to make sure your ad is going to be reached and viewed by potential customers.</p>
        <p> According to Hootsuite, people are spending more and more time on social media as it is now at the tips of fingers at any given moment. In specific, people are spending 15 more minutes using social media than watching TV. This statistic shows the large reach that is possible for choosing a social media platform over possibly television.In fact, according to the same article on Hootsuite, the number 8 reason why people use social media is to buy things, showing that an advertisment for some companies can be very effective. </p>
